Howdy!
If you are playing the game singleplayer, you DO NOT need to manually start the server, it will startup as soon as you run start-game.bat!


If you are connecting to the public server, the game will ask if you would like to at startup.


If you are NOT playing singleplayer Or connecting to the public server, and want to host a local multiplayer server, you
will have to enable it in dedicated_server_settings.json, after which you can run start-server.bat in
the server directory as an all-in-one solution, or run each individual server for more customization.
